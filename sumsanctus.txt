Maledictions 1:1 I am God's holy monster. I drink from humanity.”,
Maledictions 1:2 I could not see what part I would play for such a long time, because I looked at it with human eyes, with eyes that would die.”,
Maledictions 1:3-6 So I put forth the truth in this book, for you who seek, just as I have sought. For I am not some Godless beast who hunts beneath the grandeur of sanctity. I am the grandeur; I am sanctified.
Maledictions 1:7-9 This is who I am: I am the bearer of the Spear that pierced the side of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, Son of David, Begotten Son of God, who died at my hand and descended to Hell and bruised the head of Satan, who rose from the dead on the third day that he might save the living. But He cannot save the dead.
Maledictions 1:10 I was born on the same day as Christ, and I died on the same day. Christ was the son of a virgin; I was the son of a whore.
Maledictions 1:11 Christ taught others to treat others as they would be treated; I only sought to gain what I could, and took what I wanted, and killed whom I wanted.
Maledictions 1:12 Christ was a man of peace who never raised his hand against another man; I was a man who took pay for the deaths and pains of others.
Maledictions 1:13 Christ lived in righteousness; I lived in sin.
Maledictions 1:14 In my life, from the age of twelve, when I came into my true nature, I indulged in every sin. I gave in to anger, and beat men to death with my bare hands.
Maledictions 1:15-16 I placed myself above man and God and would not allow any man to subdue me. I slaked my lusts upon women and boys and men and beasts, and sometimes they were willing, and sometimes I paid for unclean pleasures with gold and silver and sometimes I did not, and sometimes they were not willing and I raped them.
Maledictions 1:17-19 I envied the condition of my fellow men, for I was born poor, and this led me to murder and to steal. And I hoarded the gold I stole from the men whose homes I robbed and the gold I took from the people whose taxes I collected. I gave in to strong drink, and I made myself sick with the food I ate.
Maledictions 1:20 For every good deed that Christ performed, I performed an evil deed. For every miracle and sign that Christ revealed upon the Earth, I made a tragedy come to occur. For each innocent whom Christ healed, I brought pain to an innocent, or I killed, or I maimed.
Maledictions 1:21-22 It was the perfect will of God that my life be in every way the mirror of Christ; it was God’s perfect and pleasing will that I be present at Christ’s death, and that my hand should wield my spear, and that I should deal the blow that slew him. And that I should be cursed. For God predestined me to be cursed. And this is my fate.
Maledictions 2:1-2 My name is Longinus; I have no other. 2I am a Roman, and I was born in the city of Rome to a whore; and her name was Livia. I do not know who my father was; my mother saw no wrong that in her sin — sin that led many men to ruin and debaucherye — she conceived me; and that she did know the name of the man that conceived me.
Maledictions 2:3-4 But in a dream one night, a dark man came to her and told her that he had made her pregnant with me and had paid her one denarius for the pleasure. I had the mark of God upon me, said the man, and I would be a curse upon the Earth and a vessel of God’s wrath upon the guilty and a test to the innocent, and yet she was not to harm me when I was born, for God had marked me out to bring wrath upon the Earth and bring judgment upon it. The dark man told me that I should be called Longinus; she disobeyed him and gave me another name, that I shall not name.
Maledictions 2:5-10 My mother’s home city was Nola. Her parents were still living, and she was eleven years old when she rejected their love and care and traveled to Rome. There, she lost her virginity as soon as she could, in whatever way she could; she threw herself into the slavery of lust. She taught me the things she knew, and encouraged me in her undying passion for her sin and her love of debauchery. From the age of fourteen, she sold herself to the public, and she sold herself cheaply, for she took pleasure in the evils she performed. At times, she was so enamored of the carnal evils she performed that she asked no price, and thought not of the consequences of her sin. I was made by her to beg and pick pockets as soon as I could walk, so that we might not starve.
Maledictions 2:11-17 I became known to the men and women and dogs of the streets of Rome as the Bastard, for even then, knowing that I would be more, I refused to use the name that had been given to me, and on the day that I reached the age of twelve, my mother too ceased to use the name she had given, and she too would only call me the Bastard. It was when I was twelve years of age, too, that I chose to steal my mother’s meager earnings and place a wager on the result of a chariot race in the Circus. It happened that the chariot on which I placed my mother’s money lost its wheel, and the charioteer was thrown to the earth and trampled to death under the horses of another driver. I lost the money, and when I returned home, my mother scolded me and took out a whip and meant to beat me; but even though I was a boy I was stronger than her, for she was slight, and I had strangled dogs with my bare hands and taken them home for meat. And I snatched the whip from my mother’s hand and stripped her dress from her and whipped her into the street naked, and as I pursued her into the street and whipped her bloody and seized her hair and dragged her into the forum, I cried out loud to the assembled scum of Rome: “She is a dog, fit only for mounting!” And I offered her body to the men who would take her, and took the money for my own earnings as the men of the city took their pleasure upon her, for my words were powerful and persuaded men to follow their desires.
Maledictions 2:18 And from that day on, I was master of my house, and I held the purse, and I beat my mother if she did not hand the gold to me to use as I would, and I bought her fine dresses and oils for her hair, and paint for her face, and I fed her as I would, but she was my slave, and she would not speak out against me.
Maledictions 2:19-20 And I grew to manhood, and became fond of wine. I drew companions to me, and they numbered twelve, and they were Veranius the seller of knives, and Gellius the butcher; Malchio the usurer, Ascyltus and Giton the catamites, Gaius Clodius and Lucius Clodius the sons of Sextus; Philebus and Florens; Encolpia the whore; Plotius the lover of wine; and Ganymede, whom I betrayed.
Maledictions 2:21-24 And the Twelve stood beside me in all the crimes that I would commit. When I stole, they stole with me, and when I killed, they joined in the slaughter. And when I took a woman, they would hold her and silence her, and throw her corpse into the river. A night came when I became soaked with wine, and came into my home, and seized my mother by the hair, and took my pleasure upon her. And I returned to the Twelve and boasted to them of what I had done, and said, “Am I not a more fortunate man than any of you? For who among you has had pleasure with a whore so beautiful as my ripe mother?” And so I committed the sin of lust.
Maledictions 3:1-6 And I was known as a violent man. I would have no truck with any man who disagreed with me, or thwarted me in my lust or greed or gluttony, and I killed whom I saw fit, and I fought with abandon. A seller of vegetables claimed that I had taken his wares and that I had cheated him of his due, and I told Ganymede and the sons of Sextus Clodius to hold him down, and I broke both of his arms, so that he could not dig his precious vegetables. And the son of Livia’s sister, who cheated me in a wager, his hand I cut off so that he could not cheat me again, nor anyone else. And so I committed the sin of anger. And my neighbors feared me, and they hated me. And I was content.
Maledictions 3:7-10 It so happened that a certain centurion called Pandirah had entered into a wager with me concerning the outcome of a dog fight and had won, for his dog had torn out the throat of mine, and the blood had run across the stones of the forum. Now Pandira was a corrupt man and had cheated me, but he had the swords of eighty men at his command and I had only twelve. But he claimed generosity and offered me a post as a soldier in his garrison, and I knew that I must become a soldier, and Ganymede and the sons of Sextus Clodius joined me in the arms and armor of the soldier. And so it was that I and the Three traveled to the land of Judea, there to serve as soldiers of the Emperor of Rome.
Maledictions 4:1-2 And in Judea, I saw that in my armor I was feared, and that I could take the goods that I wanted, and that I could take any woman that I wanted, and that while collecting the taxes I could add sums of my own, and I saw that it was good. And I saw that I could be rich. And so I committed the sin of greed.
Maledictions 4:3-6 But I saw that I was not a good soldier. For a centurion is a man set under authority, with soldiers under him. He says to a man “Come,” and the man comes, and he says to another, “Go,” and the man goes, and to another “Do this,” and the man does it.i But when the centurion told me to come, I did not come, and when he told me to go, I did not go. And when he told me to do a thing, I did not do it. And so I came to know the lash and the rod, and the scars grew long and red on my back, and the blood ran freely on the barracks floor. And I was made to clean out the buckets of waste, and to scrub the barracks floor. And I was humiliated. But Ganymede and the sons of Sextus Clodius found that they took pleasure in the training and the order of the army, and grew in favor with the decurion and the centurion. And when a stone cast by a Judean killed a centurion, Pandira chose from the men Ganymede and raised him up.
Maledictions 4:7 And I grew envious of Ganymede, and I spoke to a brothel-keeper that we both knew, and I caused the brothel-keeper to give to Ganymede a woman who hated the Romans, and arranged for her to be given a knife, and when Ganymede went into the woman’s room to take his pleasure with her, she thrust the dagger into Ganymede’s eye and Ganymede was dead. And I had done this for no other reason that Ganymede had been raised up and I had not.
Maledictions 4:8-10 I killed the woman myself, and I paid the brothel-keeper for his silence, and I told Pandira that Ganymede had been avenged. But the brothel-keeper was greedy and sought to gain more, and went to Pandira and told him that I had arranged for my friend’s death. Pandira hated me, and went to Pilate the governor. And Pilate called me to account, and they stripped me of my arms and brought me to trial. And I was threatened with the sword. The brothel-keeper stood and accused me. But God made it so that Pilate did not believe the man and I escaped death, for He had set apart for me a fate that was beyond the fate of a common soldier under sentence of death.
Maledictions 5:1-3 This is what had happened. One night several months previously I had left the barracks and sought to rob a beautiful young man I had seen many times before, and enjoy his tender rump, and kill him. And I saw the youth, and followed him to the place where I had decided to draw my sword and take him. But I lost sight of the boy, until I heard a cry, and ran to the sound of the cry, and saw that another man had seen the boy and had wanted him for his own, and had stripped him and was sodomizing him. I flew into a rage and grabbed the boy’s assailant by the throat and threw him to the ground and ground my heel upon his manhood and kicked him in the face and the gut until the blood flowed on the dirt and he begged and screamed no more.”
Maledictions 5:4-5 I turned upon the boy, but before I could take him myself, the boy thanked me and told me that he was the servant of Proclak, the wife of Pilate the governor, and asked me to take the ring that he pressed into my hand, on which was the seal of Pilate’s wife. And so I did not take my pleasure on the boy that night, but returned to the barracks.
Maledictions 5:6-8 And I remembered this, and sent the seal-ring from the barracks where I had been confined with Lucius the son of Sextus Clodius, and so when the day of the trial came and the brothel-keeper came to speak, Pilate refused to believe him, for Procla had come to him and had told him how I had saved her favored servant, although she did not know that I had intended to rob and to sodomize the youth myself. And I was set free and the brothel-keeper was flogged for his presumption, and the night after I was set free, I went to the brothel-keeper’s brothel and found the man, and made sure he could see my face, and strangled him.
Maledictions 6:1 And my lot became better after the trial, for Procla sent for me and thanked me for saving her favored servant, and said that she had asked Pilate that I be placed in the guard of her household as a reward. And I thanked her, and I lusted after her in my heart, but I knew that I should not slake my lusts on her, for she was the maker of my freedom.
Maledictions 6:2 And I thought it good to be a member of the governor’s guard. And one night, I stole into the quarters of Pandira the centurion and took a silver neck-chain that he had often worn and had been seen to wear. And I covered my face and went into the room of Procla and spilled my seed upon her bed, and saw her awaken, and held her mouth so that she could not scream and left the room, and left Pandira’s silver neck-chain behind.
Maledictions 6:3-7 And I was the one who came to Procla’s room first when she screamed, and I made show of finding the neck-chain, and pretended not to know whose it was, but one of the other soldiers recognized it and accused Pandira, and we arrested him, and he was put to trial. And although he vowed he was innocent, he could not say where he was, for he was away from the barracks, stealing from another man’s house. And so Pandira was put to death, and I was the one who stood with Pandira at sunset and held the sword that took off his head, and I pretended friendship with Pandira and shed tears while in my heart I was laughing. And the blood ran freely over the courtyard, and pooled into the cracks between the stones, and shone in the torchlight, and filled the air with its stench. And I rejoiced.
Maledictions 7:1-3 And I was still known as the Bastard to some, and others called me the Soldier, and to the Jews I was the Son of Satan, and I was pleased, for it meant that they feared me. I saw that my rise within the service of Pilate and Proclawas not fate, and began to believe that the God of the Jews, who they said saw all things and knew all things and governed all things, had raised me for a purpose, although I did not know what it was. And I knew that my sin, for which the sin of no other man was a match, had set me apart for a place in history, although I did not know what it was.
Maledictions 7:4-5 But as I was sent to lead men to defeat the rebellious Jews, I saw that I loved to make the blood flow freely, and that the sight of blood was more intoxicating than the taste of wine, and that the smell of blood was more pleasurable than the smell of a woman’s crotch. And sometimes, when no one except the sons of Sextus Clodius saw, I put my hand in the blood I had spilled and raised the hand to my mouth, and tasted it, and commanded the sons of Sextus Clodius to do likewise. And it was good.
Maledictions 7:6-7 But I did not know that this was not the blasphemy that I was ordained to do, and I lived content in my bloodshed and my sin. The time was not yet right for the Son of the Damned to be revealed in all his glory, nor was it right that I should yet lead the Damned to true salvation.
Maledictions 8:1-4 In two years, I had become the captain of Pilate's guard, and I was made centurion. It happened that a merchant named Phaecus came to Jerusalem. Now Phaecus was a dishonest man, and Pilate had him brought before him, for he had not paid his taxes. Phaecus begged and wheedled, and offered the governor a bribe, and gave Pilate treasures from his ship: some gold plate, some gemstones and pearls, some small amount of Tyrian purple, and the tip of a spear made of some black metal, that Phaecus told Pilate had been the weapon of a king, although Pilate did not believe him. But Pilate set the man free.
Maledictions 8:5-7 Now the festival of the Passover that the Jews celebrate came near, and Pilate saw fit to give out the things the merchant had given him to his friends to mark the festival. But the Spearhead he gave to me. And he told me that it had been the weapon of a king. And I took it and affixed it to a good new shaft out of pride, for it meant that I was the favored man of the governor and of the governor’s wife. And so I committed the sin of pride.
Maledictions 9:1-3 The Spearhead was the weapon that God had destined to strike Christ in the side. It had been made long ago in the days before the Deluge by Tubal-Cain the Smith, the son of Zillah, the second wife of Lamech, the son of Enoch. Tubal-Cain’s son had struck his grandfather Lamech’s face, and Lamech had slain him. Tubal-Cain sought revenge, and prayed to God that his son be avenged. On the night that Tubal-Cain prayed, a stone fell from the sky, and it was hard, and it was black, and Tubal-Cain saw that God had answered his prayer, and from the metal in the stone he fashioned a Spearhead, that he might kill Lamech.
Maledictions 9:4-6 But Tubal-Cain failed, for Lamech was a mighty warrior, and Lamech laid his foot on Tubal-Cain’s neck and seized the Spear, and impaled Tubal-Cain through the heart, and Tubal-Cain died. And Lamech took the Spear for his own, and it became a sign for all who would see that Lamech was a mighty warrior before the LORD, and he slew all of his enemies and was made king, and went forth on a war of conquest, and was victorious against every man he faced, until the LORD saw fit to strike down humanity in the Flood, and Lamech was drowned, and the Spear was lost.
Maledictions 9:7-8 But the Spear was not marred by time, and its head did not rust or decay, and it remained as sharp and as hard as the day it was forged, when a ship captain from Tyre found it lying on a beach in the sand, and traded it to the merchant Phaecus, who gave it to Pontius Pilate that he might not be imprisoned or killed, who gave it to Longinus, that he might strike Christ in the side and incur the curse of God, and become a sign to the Damned of God’s perfect will for them.
Maledictions 10: 1-2 I had heard of Jesus of Nazareth, but I had never seen Him. I was afraid. For he was a good man, and He had healed the servant of a centurion I had known who had become a follower of this man and had abandoned his arms. And Procla had begun to dream of Him, and she had told her husband Pilate of her dreams in my hearing. And I did not care to know more about this Jesus, because he was one of many Jewish rebels, and because I needed no healing, and I did not need to repent, for I was content.”
Maledictions 10:3 And I had heard of his message that people could be saved by his words, and I thought that absurd, for no man can be saved by anything other than a blade.”
Maledictions 10:4 And I heard of his healings, and thought that I did not need to be healed.“
Maledictions 10:5 And I had heard his curses upon the men of violence, and the men of authority and on the rich, and I laughed, for the proud do not need to inherit the earth, for it is theirs now, and the rich and the doers of violence have the power of the lives of all, and no preaching can change that.”
Maledictions 10:6 And I considered a message of reconciliation and forgiveness to be a woman’s message, for I had never forgiven man or woman in my life, and had never been forgiven anything, nor did I expect forgiveness.
Maledictions 10:7-8 And it happened that on that day when Christ was betrayed by one of his own followers, and brought before the Sanhedrin and then before Pilate, I was not present, because God had caused my eye to swell up and fill with blood, and my sight was blurred and weak.”
Maledictions 10:9 And so while Jesus Christ was on trial before Pilate, I slept, and while he was beaten on the road to Calvary, I ate grapes with the sons of Sextus Clodius and enjoyed the white flesh of a slave girl, and drank wine from Pilate’s cellars. And so I committed the sin of gluttony.
Maledictions 10:10-12 But at the fifth hour of that day, a messenger from Pilate came and said, “Look, it is the twelfth hour of the day, and you and your companions must rise, and go to the three crucified men on Calvary and make sure that they are dead. And you must take them down and hand them over to be buried, for the Jews will not allow corpses to hang on the cross on the day of their Sabbath.”
Maledictions 10:13-14 And I and the sons of Sextus Clodius rose and strapped on our breastplates and our swords and our cloaks, and rode to Calvary, and arrived at the turn of the sixth hour, and there were the three men on the three crosses: the thief Gestas on the left hand, and the thief Dysmas on the right, and Jesus Christ between them.
Maledictions 10:15 And many people standing before Jesus Christ, weeping and rending their clothes, among them a youth and a woman, and Jesus Christ still spoke to them, and closed his eyes, although I did not hear what he said. And I ordered the sons of Sextus Clodius to drive them away, and they did,
Maledictions 10:16 and they seized from the woman and the youth a shirt that had belonged to Jesus Christ, and they saw that it had no seam, and they began to quarrel over which of them should receive it, and I told them to play dice for it, but that they should hurry, for they had not yet killed the criminals. And at this time the sky turned black, as if it were night.
Maledictions 10:17 I commanded another soldier, who was already present, to break the legs of the men, and he took up a cudgel and broke the legs of the thief Gestas and the thief Dysmas, but he would not break the legs of Jesus Christ, for he said that the man was already dead.
Maledictions 10:18-19 I rode my horse towards the man Jesus Christ and brought my face to his chest, and I could hear that he was breathing, and I cursed the soldier for a fool, and would have told the man to assault Jesus Christ with the cudgel, when the man Jesus opened his eyes and looked at me, and looked to Heaven, and I cowered before the eyes of Jesus Christ, for I saw that should I ask, he would forgive me, and a woman among those weeping nearby raised her voice and begged that I show mercy to the man Jesus Christ and take him down.
Maledictions 10:20-21 And the earth shook. And I doubted myself and said, “Truly, this man was the Son of God.” And I wanted to flee, but I would not show cowardice to the weaklings who wept for this man.
Maledictions 10:22-23 And I thought I might take the man down and show mercy to him, for I knew that Pilate had not wished to execute him, but I did not wish to explain myself, nor did I wish to find a carpenter, nor did I wish to find men to bring down the cross. And so I committed the sin of sloth.
Maledictions 10:24 And I raised my Spear and thrust it into the man Jesus Christ’s side, and the blood flowed freely, mixed with waterv, and ran down the shaft of the blade and onto my hand.
Maledictions 10:25 And Jesus died and let out a cry, and the earth shook, and the graves of the dead split open. And the dead lay still within them. And I cried out, too, for I realized that all of this was God’s will, and the dead rose, and began to walk, and hungered.
Maledictions 10:26-27 I raised my hand and wiped my forehead and a drop of blood fell in my eye, and my eye was healed. And I licked the blood from my hand, and it tasted sweet. And I knew that I was damned.
Maledictions 11:1-6 Seeing that Christ was dead, the soldiers did not break his legs. But instead one of the soldiers pierced His side with a Spear, and blood and water flowed out. A drop of blood fell upon the soldier’s lips, and he wiped it away with his hand. Yet the next day, he slept past the sunrise, and only awoke from his sleep at nightfall. And after tasting Christ’s blood, he thirsted for more. I know these things, and I know because I am the soldier.
Maledictions 11:7-8 My sight was restored; and it was beyond the clarity of mortals, and made better than it had ever been; I was blind, and now I see, for God wished me to see all things as they truly are. For clarity of sight was necessary for the ministry that God had entrusted to me.
Maledictions 11:9 I saw that I had by my own free will removed myself from the light of God, and that no salvation would exist for me, and I understood what it meant to be Damned as I had not understood it before,
Maledictions 11:10 and at the moment Jesus died, I died, too, and my heart ceased to beat, and I ceased to draw breath. And I declared that this man was the Son of God, for it was the truth.
Maledictions 11:11 And I was Longinus, the bearer of the Spear, and would be, and will be forever, world without end until such time as Christ returns in glory and wrath and ends the world, and I shepherd the Damned into the arms of Hell and Death, and I shall rejoice, and they shall rejoice with me, for that is their lot.”
Maledictions 11:12 And I rode from that place and found a dark place where I could hide from the sun, for I was afraid, and I slept, and did not awaken until the sun had risen and set once more.
Maledictions 12:1 I awoke and left the city, and went into the wilderness, wandered, hungry and yet unable to eat, and numb and like a man in fever. And for forty nights I starved in the wilderness, and for forty days I slept, and on the forty-first night, Satan came to me in the likeness of my mother, and I was tempted.
Maledictions 12:2-3 And my mother said to me, “If you are truly the first of the Damned, you can feed from the living without remorse,” and she took me to a place where a shepherd-boy slept by a fire, and she invited me to feed from the child, and I took the boy by the throat and drank deeply of his blood, and the boy died, and I was strengthened, and I rejoiced.
Maledictions 12:4 And she took me to the pinnacle of the Temple, and said, “If you are truly the eternal Damned, throw yourself from this Temple, for your injuries shall bind themselves.” And I threw myself from the Temple, and I landed on the courtyard, and was broken. And the Blood healed me, and my bones knitted together, and my body was whole again.
Maledictions 12:5 And then she took me to a high place that oversaw a graveyard, and she said, “If you are truly the prophet of the Damned, command the dead to rise and bow down before you,” and I spoke out loud: “Arise,” and a dozen of the dead — the unrighteous dead — rolled back the stones of their tombs, and bowed down before me. And they were hungry, and I commanded that they go out into the city and sate their hunger.
Maledictions 12:6-7 And Satan kissed me, and left me, and I left that place, and I understood my mandate and my mission, which is in the Blood.
Maledictions 12:8-9 I saw the proof of my power over the mortal sheep; I kept the hungry wolves in the boiling cauldron of my heart. And the mixture is a miracle, and has raised the Predator over the Prey.
Maledictions 12:10 Blood burns like the fire. Blood thunders like the storm.
Maledictions 12:11 Blood runs freely and stains the earth through eternity, for we only have the appearance of eternity, but the Blood remains.
Maledictions 12:12 I knew that I must become the master of the Blood or forever be its slave.
Maledictions 12:13 And I rejoiced, for I knew I was Damned, and that God willed it so.
Maledictions 13:1-2 In the city of Jerusalem, I met others who were Damned as I, but they did not truly understand it, and mocked me, as I had mocked Christ. And they tried to drive me away, for they considered the sheep on whom I had fed to be their herd. And I cursed them: ”Woe to you, you Elders! For you hoard the Blood to yourselves, and yet you do not understand it.” And for a time, they left me, and considered my words.
Maledictions 13:3 I no longer lusted after women; I no longer desired wine; I no longer hungered after fine foods. I had no wish for wealth, for I did not need treasures on Earth, when I had treasures in Hell.
Maledictions 13:4 But I did not know what I should do, and would have lost my mind, if I had not decided that God wished more of me.
Maledictions 13:5-6 And I held the others in contempt: for though I could see that they slept and hunted and fed in the streets of the city, they were like the beasts of the wild. They were Damned, and they stalked inside the walls, and they snarled, and they behaved like wolves or lions, but they did not have the thoughts of men.
Maledictions 13: 7-8 They were thirsty, to no purpose. I hoped that I might find my Damned Kindred among them, but how could I know what to tell them, until I had heard myself the things I should tell?
Maledictions 14:1-3 Now one night I happened upon a woman, on whom I decided to feed. But I could not feed from her, nor could I lay a hand on her. And instead I spoke to her and asked her who she was, and she told me: “I am no one, but I follow one greater than I, and His name is Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who died and was buried, who rose again on the third day, and who ascended to Heaven.” And I was dumbfounded, and I let her go. And I found that I could not feed on those who followed Christ.
Maledictions 14:4 And I feared to go to the tomb of Christ and see for myself for thirty-three years. But when those years had passed, I dreamed of owls, and I saw that I must travel to the sepulcher and see for myself.
Maledictions 14:5 I waited until the night was dark, and clouds obscured the moon, and I found that the tomb was still empty, and I knew that the tales of the resurrection and ascension of the man Jesus Christ were true.
Maledictions 14:6-7 And there appeared to me a blinding light, and I cowered in the tomb, thinking the sun had risen, but there stood before me archangel Vahishtael, with black wings and the heads of a calf, a serpent and a wolf, and holding a spear like the Spear I still held, and he spoke to me, and said: “Fear me, Longinus. For I am the messenger of your purpose.”
Maledictions 14:8 “The Damned are many, and they are denied salvation.”
Maledictions 14:9-10 “But the Damned serve as the sign to humanity of the price of sin, and to make mortals fear and to understand that their lives are brief and full of pain, and they can only see the most pitiful reflection of the glories of Heaven, for they do not see clearly, but see as if through a blurred mirror, and the Damned do not see through the mirror at all.”
Maledictions 14:11 “And it is the lot of the Damned to take the blood of mortals, that mortals might know that they will die, and that their only salvation is in the next life.”
Maledictions 14:12 “And it is your lot to go and give this message to all of the Damned, that they might know God’s purpose for them and rejoice.”
